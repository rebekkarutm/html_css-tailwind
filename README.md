# html_css-tailwind
Introduction to Tailwind by creating a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind.

This project is a simple two-page website of a fictitious company named The Human Earth Society for Humans. The webpage lists some information about the company as well as an option to sign up for their newsletter.

I used VSCode to create the website and Figma to create the images. The biggest challenge was to organise the layout of the webpage using the Tailwind model. I felt it slowed things down a bit as I'm not too familiar with Tailwind but I managed to make it work. I enjoyed this assignment and learned new things such as creating a form, making a sticky footer, and using Tailwind of course!
